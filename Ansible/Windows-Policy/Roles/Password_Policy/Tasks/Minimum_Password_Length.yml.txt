# Minimum password length

# This security setting determines the least number of characters that a password for a user account may contain.
# You can set a value of between 1 and 14 characters, or you can establish that no password is required by setting the number of characters to 0.

# Default:

# 7 on domain controllers.
# 0 on stand-alone servers.

# Note: By default, member computers follow the configuration of their domain controllers.
