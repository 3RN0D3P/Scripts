# Password must meet complexity requirements

# This security setting determines whether passwords must meet complexity requirements.

# If this policy is enabled, passwords must meet the following minimum requirements:

# Not contain the user's account name or parts of the user's full name that exceed two consecutive characters
# Be at least six characters in length
# Contain characters from three of the following four categories:
# English uppercase characters (A through Z)
# English lowercase characters (a through z)
# Base 10 digits (0 through 9)
# Non-alphabetic characters (for example, !, $, #, %)
# Complexity requirements are enforced when passwords are changed or created.

# Default:

# Enabled on domain controllers.
# Disabled on stand-alone servers.

# Note: By default, member computers follow the configuration of their domain controllers.
